  <h1>As we know there are two sides; dark andlight. (I used shortened names for the songs such as HH for HALA HALA, IL forIllusion and so on…)</h1>
  <p>As we know there are two sides; dark and light. (I used shortened names for the songs such as HH for HALA HALA, IL for Illusion and so on…)
    Mingi is the leader/authority in dark side (don’t worry, every member has a significant role). We can understand that from his first appearance in PK. As he enters the song, the screen glitches to red and then turns black. And it turns back to normal when his verse ends.</p>
  <p>Wooyoung is the right arm of him; he takes orders from him and obeys him. In PK he also causes a glitch and we all know his creepy part “Will you be my friend”. Also, in SMN, he says “Yes sir, responding to that call” and bows down; he refers to Mingi. Hongjoong also has the same line but doesn’t bow down, on the contrary, he looks like he wants to attack someone. This is an important point because Hongjoong also has a very significant role (just like any other member).</p>
  <p>Hongjoong does not necessarily belong to the light side but he aims to take over the dark side after joining it with other members. The only way to do that is to overthrow Mingi. Through the whole story, Mingi is always talking about the treasure and how to reach it. However, Hongjoong is always telling us to ‘join him’. Even though all of the members are talking about joining them, Hongjoong’s tone and words are a little bit different.</p>
  <p>I saw a lot of analyses about the use of red color on him in PK and TR; red color symbolizes danger/warning. We can say that Hongjoong is the danger. For a very long time in the story, he remains a danger because he is always talking about having his own crew and ‘doing something’ other than finding the treasure; taking the control of dark side. But he always acts like he is with Mingi in the dark side. Returning back to the “Yes sir, responding to that call” line, we can see him acting obedient to gain trust. The trumpet that we keep seeing is the symbol of authority they both want to have.</p>
  <p>As Hongjoong drops it in SMN, he starts his‘acting’ about accepting Mingi’s authority. But in songs, he still keepstalking to us to join him or accept him as our ‘captain’.</p>
  <p>Moving on, HH is obviously about their darkside. At the beginning Seonghwa talks about his excitement about being a partof the dark side; “meeting a new side of me”. So, HH is about their entrance tothe dark side. In HHwe see San and Jongho are kind of connected to each other. “Deepin my heart/Deep in my soul/Coming to that flashing light/Deep down myheart/Deep down my soul” Jongho talks about the light in them, referring to theremaining light side in them (which is in the past now) ButSan interrupts him “That never dying sparkling fire yeah”, to drag him into thedark side again. San and Jongho have that conflict between them in every titlesong/MV. But they also encourage being and staying together to be successful.</p>
  <p>In PK, San says “It is meaninglessif you're alone” and Jongho adds “We can make everything together”. They areboth encouraging ATEEZ to stay as a team and act as one to be successful; to beable to find the treasure. Eventhough San advertises the dark side more, he invites everyone to have and keepharmony. However, we see a betrayal in the story. It is portrayed by the brokenmirrors around San in SMN. (I’m going to return back to that point)</p>
  <p>Yeosang;he is kept in a glass prison (that shines so bright) in SMN. As you can see, hedoesn’t have his dark side outfits, which means he is still in the light sidein that scene. But the dark Wooyoung is looking at him as if he is a pray.</p>
  <p>Thatmight mean Yeosang is related with the treasure. Because he is the only one inPK and SMN who resists to the dark side. Also, he has the key as necklace in Wonderland photos. In SMN he says “maybe this is the destiny”; he accepts his fate and joins the darkside; the glass cage becomes empty. Also, at the end of SMN we hear TR while itshows that glass cage. That is a proof that Yeosang is related to the treasuremore than others. InIL, he is the watchman and has binoculars. So, he is defining the route forreaching the treasure. But IL and WV are about the failure of their attempt tofind the treasure and trying again. So,Yeosang leads them in a wrong way. He probably does this intentionally, becausehe still rejects darkness. At this point, Yunho becomes an important figure.</p>
  <p>In the story he is the most desperate one; he tries to find a way out of this darkand light situation. Heis surrounded with research and communication materials in SMN. At the end ofSMN, after Yeosang accepts the destiny, they are together with him and Yunho says “please don’t let me go”. This means Yunho is the last person to resistdarkness. Ofcourse, he becomes a part of the dark side, but he doesn’t let it take overhim, yet. In SMN he throws away the papers he was working on for solution. Thisis his first surrender but it is not totally over for him yet.</p>
  <p>After the Wonderland teasers, everyone started to talk about the ‘Alice’ theme.We don’t exactly know if they are influenced by the book or the movie. It isreally important because there are a lot of differences between them. But most of the main details are the same. People were saying Yunho can be the white rabbit; I agree on that. And we have proof.Today I noticed something on his sweater in Treasure Film Ep. 2; they gave usthe clue very obviously.</p>
  <p>Him being the White Rabbit means that he is trying very hard to achieve his goal before it is too late and maybe save everyone. But dark side is stronger than he thinks; he surrenders again in his WL teaser.</p>
  <p>(But Yeosang and Yunho are the ones who know about the treasure the most, that’s whyYunho keeps saying stuff like ‘don’t lose me, don’t leave me’ and why the restare trying so hard to bring Yeosang to the dark side)</p>
  <p>The screens around him are (again) means that he was watching over to find a clue,but in the teaser, he looks at the screens and there is no signal. The fewscreens that still has the imagery show only fire and glitch; the dark side. (Also,there is a number; 9 in one screen: “9 is a number forlightworkers and those who live and lead in life by positive example. Charitywork is priority with a sense of selflessness…and living a purposeful life”.Again, a clue about Yunho being the good character with a goal to help others)</p>
  <p>When it comes to Seonghwa, he is the most neutral and calm character in the story.After joining the dark side, he does not try to resist it; he even talks aboutthe good feeling that his new identity gives him (HH). Inhis WL teaser, he blows a match; Wooyoung lights a match in IL. ConsideringWooyung as the devil’s servant, we might say that Seonghwa prevents a bigdestruction that he was planning to cause. Wooyoung being chained in WL teasermight be the proof of him failing because of Seonghwa.</p>
  <p>We also have Mingi in WL teaser, staying inside of a fire chamber. Mingi beingtrapped, Wooyoung being chained… It is obvious that the darkest part of darkside is inhibited. But this doesn’t mean the dark side lost the conflict. Onthe contrary, it caused all of them to get rid of the tension between two sidesand accept their togetherness. How? Let’s return back to San: back to San and the Alice theme, San is obviously the Caterpillarfrom “Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland”.</p>
  <p>His hair might be a clue for that,caterpillar’s inner part of the body is a different shade than their upperpart. San’s hair has the same style. As a very important character, Caterpillaris the only one in Wonderland who knows everything about this place. San is the only one that knows to embraceand control both the darkness and the light inside him from the beginning. Inthe book, Caterpillar keeps asking Alice “Who are you?”. So, San wants everyoneto see their true selves and embrace it; the harmony of their good and badside.</p>
  <p>If we return back to the betrayal, Italked abt before, we also see it in the WL teaser. He sits on a place coveredwith flowers but there are piques/harpoons around him that resembles ‘beingstabbed in the back’. The betrayal doesn’t need to be from a member. It might be a symbol for showing‘desperation happens if you let one side take the control of you’. So, we cansay that if his warnings and advices pay off and all of them learn to accepttheir true form, which is the mixture of two. At the end they stop fighting against eachother and unite their powers to find the treasure.</p>
  <p>Returning to Jongho, we see a clear pattern of Cheshire Cat on his shirt. Inthe book, Cheshire Cat is not that close to Alice but he has a very importantrole; Alice asks him which way to go since she is lost. And the Cheshire Cattells her that where she goes doesn’t matter if she doesn’t have a place/goal to reach. So, Jongho and San are the ones who shows the path to others; you can think San as the way to the dark side and Jongho tothe light side. But they both encourage others to meet as one under the samegoal. Hongjoong’s two braids on his hair might bethe symbol for the connection between both sides (remember the pictures of HH& SMN with the rope)</p>
  <p>In the performance preview of WL, we seeall of them being very powerful and confident; they keep saying “let’s go” to show their new starting point as their new selves. Even though WL is not the last MV of thestory, we can clearly see from concept photos that they find the treasure atthe end. Everything on them are golden, they have many medals which means theywon a ‘war’ against themselves.</p>
 <br><br>
<p>In conclusion, the storyline actuallygives us a really good lesson; we cannot be pure good or evil, all of us haveboth in us. What is important is to stay together as one and learn to controlthe power that our dark side gives us to find the treasure that is inside us. At the end ATEEZ find their power bystaying together and being a true team. So… As we all know, at the end; <b style="color: #4CBFD6">8 </b> <b style="color: #F5DE1A">MAKES</b> <b style="color: #E4620D">1</b> <b style="color: #D2141B">TEAM!</b></p>
